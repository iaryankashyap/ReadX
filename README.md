# ReadX
Checks Readability of a paragraph.

The history of readability can be traced back to the nineteenth century. In an age of progress, education was no exception. Reforms meant that education was becoming more widely available and literacy rose significantly.

The average sentence length at this time was around 26 words – a very long sentence by today’s standards.

The first effort to grade texts for different reading ages came during this time when the classrooms were getting bigger. Educators realized they needed to teach difficult concepts in plain language for the children they were teaching. The idea of readability was born.
